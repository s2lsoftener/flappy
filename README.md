# flappy

A PIXI.js flappy clone I threw together in an hour to show my cousin how fun dev can be, but in the end I don't think he's interested ðŸ™ƒ

This repo's package configs might be useful for a later project I guess.

- TypeScript
- Pixi.js v6
- Eslint, Prettier
- Webpack
- VS Code Node.js devcontainer

```bash
pnpm install
```
